# Homebrew Cask for Mission Control.
#
# This installs the DMG from GitHub Releases. It works whether or not the app
# is notarized; if it isn't, macOS shows a one-time "Open Anyway" prompt (see
# the README). Publish it by copying this file into a tap repo named
# `homebrew-tap` under your account, so users can run:
#
#     brew install --cask jokeane9/tap/mission-control-desktop
#
# Update `version` and `sha256` on each release. Get the checksum with:
#     shasum -a 256 dist/MissionControl-<version>.dmg
cask "mission-control-desktop" do
  version "1.0.0"
  sha256 :no_check # replace with the real DMG checksum once a release is cut
